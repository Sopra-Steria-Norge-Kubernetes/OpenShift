# Introduction
Sopra Steria’s managed container platform enables customers to build, deploy, and scale containerized applications in a production-ready environment based on Red Hat OpenShift.

By abstracting away Kubernetes complexity, the platform allows developers to focus on delivering business value through applications and services—faster and more securely.

The platform is available across multiple deployment models:

* Public cloud - AWS, Azure and GCP
* Private cloud - Sopra Sterias SolidCloud
* Sovereign cloud with dedicated infrastructure which can be hosted in the customer’s and providers data center

Sopra Steria managed container services enables customers to establish, organize, run and scale containerized applications in a production-ready environment. The services are based on Red Hat OpenShift. Developers are allowed to focus on building and running applications and services, as the kubernetes complexity is reduced. 

The figure below illustrates the architecture and key components of the CPaaS offering:
