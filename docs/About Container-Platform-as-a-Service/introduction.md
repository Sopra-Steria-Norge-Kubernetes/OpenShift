# Introduction

Sopra Sterias "Container Platform as a service" enables customers to establish, organize, run and scale containerized applications in a production-ready environment. The service is based on Red Hat OpenShift. Developers are allowed to focus on building and running applications and services, as the kubernetes complexity is reduced. Key benefits are:

* Faster development of new services, as new projects are equipped with a standard set of resources and workflows. The workflows allow developers to build secure and scaleable applications from day 1.
* Continous deployment of new features, as developers have full control over their release cycle. Developers are allowed to publish applications internaly or directly to the internet, depending on the customer policies. 
* Streamlined development process as the service includes tooling for continous deployment, vulnerability scanning and pre-defined framework conditions for applications.
* Compliance with regulatory demands that require that data are stored in a national cloud. The service can also be delivered on hyperscalers such as Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services.
* Backed by a team of Kubernetes experts that continously developes the service based on customer requirements and requests.
