# Service breakdown

Sopra Steria‚Äôs Container Platform as a Service (CPaaS) is offered in several variants, allowing organizations to choose the right level of isolation, functionality, and operational responsibility.

Each variant builds on a common foundation of managed Kubernetes (OpenShift) clusters, delivered with integrated platform services and tailored to fit different customer needs‚Äîfrom minimal clusters to fully integrated development environments.

## Overview of Variants

| Service                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Dedicated Container Platform** | A fully isolated, customer-specific container platform for hosting and managing multiple Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters. Ideal for sovereign cloud or high-compliance environments. Includes full control and the ability to add optional services. |
| **Cluster as a Service**         | A minimal, standalone Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster managed by Sopra Steria. Includes the core platform foundation‚Äîlifecycle, networking, security, logging, and storage. |
| **Cluster as a Service Premium** | A managed cluster with built-in developer environments (Tenants), GitOps pipelines, identity management, observability, and policy enforcement. Designed to be production-ready from day one. |
