A Kustomization file can be used to define multiple Kubernetes resoucres. It will only deploy the Kubernetes resources listed in the kustomization (<code>kustomization.yaml</code>) file like this:</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\n\nresources:\n  - deployment.yaml\n  - service.yaml\n</code></pre> <p>This will deploy <code>deployment.yaml</code> and <code>service.yaml</code> from the current folder. </p> <p>With Kustomize you can use yaml-files from a common base, and you can patch enviroment spesific values. Here's an example where files from a base (<code>../../base/application</code>) is used and the number of replicas for the Deloyment <code>app-deployment</code> is patched to <code>3</code>:</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\n\nresources:\n- ../../base/application\n\npatches:\n- target:\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: app-deployment\n  patch: |\n    - op: replace\n      path: /spec/replicas\n      value: 3\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, you can leverage Git and its references to extract your base configuration into an external repository, allowing you to version control your configuration by utilizing branches and tags in Git.</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\n\nresources:\n- https://&lt;git remo url&gt;//base/application?ref={&lt;branch&gt;,&lt;tag&gt;,&lt;commit id&gt;}\n\npatches:\n- target:\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: app-deployment\n  patch: |\n    - op: replace\n      path: /spec/replicas\n      value: 3\n</code></pre> <p>Use Kustomize cli to test your configuration.</p>"},{"location":"About%20Container-Platform-as-a-Service/Service%20Breakdown/GitOps/gitops-setup/#3-helm","title":"3) Helm","text":"<p>Helm is another effective tool for deploying and managing Kubernetes applications.
